# Unfinished Task:

None. Our tasks listed on the Pivotal Tracker have all been completed hence the right progress has been reflected on Pivotal Tracker.

# Meeting Overview:
In the meeting, team May The Fork B With You has reflected on their success, mistakes and barriers faced across Sprint 3 and also the entire project. The meeting has been held with every team member participating from 20:10 to 21:00 on Wednesday, July 19th, 2017. 

This meeting primarily summarized the completion of each features and functionalities in this project and organized the discussion on the potential integration of our web application to the real market. Due to the fact we have achieved every single designed features of our project, the atmosphere throughout the meeting is relaxed. This is because, file and image uploading, the most essential hence difficult function has been achieved with the help of express-fileupload module of nodejs. Sprint 3 is not surrounded with any important and challenging issues so it ultimately sees our final achievement to success. 

As our project comes to the stage of completion, the user stories recorded in the backlog, besides the ones we decided, in the last Release Planning Meeting, to remove from Pivotal Tracker, have all been realized and exhibited in the last demo. As a result, the size and priority of each individual user stores are not subject to any modifications. However, as we have discussed in the last two sprints, because of the nature as a web application, the traditional CRC model is decided unfit to our project although the system design still display the structure of the project by emulating the charts from CRC model. The structure described in the system design file remained identical to the last two sprints as no major change of the overall skeleton ends up applying to our project. This also demonstrated the clarity of our design on the project's structure at Sprint 0, the first place. This credit can be awarded to Sam, our product owner.

The web application did not exactly conform the classification of traditional software projects, especially the ones developed in Java and Android. The entire project has been divided heavily based on the MVC model that constitutes the model, view and controller. The model is constructed as we have embedded a database with large scale. This database recorded the information regarding users and their corresponding data such as profile photos, file they uploaded, friends they added as well as their password, email and other security-related information. Indeed, the integration of database has contributed tremendously to the success of the final project and been always considered as the escence of the project. The use of controller is also dedicated to the interaction with the backend through http-based functions and retrieves the necessary data from the database through the codes formulated in the back-end. In general, the application of MVC model guides us to the eventual achievement of our planned goals.

The ability to finish all the conceived goals from the beginning of the project composes the happiness at the final stage of Sprint 3. Throughout the whole project, we experienced a lot of frustrating impediments that discouraged us sometimes to pursue the implementation of some goals. The sporadic lack of communication among the team member also led us to question the quality of our collaboration sometimes. However, we, as a whole team, finally overcame the barriers with the application of the knowledge we gathered in CSCC01 course. This project serves as a perfect opportunities for us to encounter and walk through the problems and solutions we are taught in the lecture. This made the chapters in the course not only important theoretically but also helpful in the real life project. Thanks to the appropriate application of some design patterns and models introduced in the course, our teamwork can succeed and thrive at last.

The productivity can only be sparkled due to the involvement of the following strengths. Some of them are carried from the previous sprints and finally contribute to the success of the whole project as an entirity:
- Maintain the frequency of group discussion and communication
- Testing the codes whenever a small task labelled under each user story is upon completion
- Share the opinion and suggestion for the difficulties faced by each individual teammate
- Always push the most recent codes to remote repository to keep everyone on track

On the other hand, a few problems have also been complained about by the teammates. The lack of responses from some teammates have been the centre of some criticisms. This disabled the rest of the team to be aware of the exact progress of the implementations. Sometimes, the user stories may be built on top of each other so without knowing the exact progress of the implementation, the product owner can hardly ensure the coordination of multiple distinct functions. This may cause irreversible errors when the codes are merged in the remote repository. For this weakness, constructive advice such as turning the notification on in the phone and computer has been given and hopefully can help the team members solve this problem for the preparation of our final presentation and their future team collaboration.

Although this project has given us a few sleepless nights and comsumed a lot of our time we originally designated to other major computer science course such as CSCC43 and CSCC69, we have harvested the invaluable experience of web development. It is the first-hand access to actually design and implement a web product which is considered as a popular form of software and internet service in the real market. Our entire team is now able to see the intact picture of a web application and the relevent component of a development cycle which can certainly benefit us to be actively engaged in engineering a large and complex web product.

This sprint is the last stage of development but it does not mark the end of our teamwork. The preparation of final presentation is still ongoing while small changes and decors are conducted on the project. Some files and database will be moved to the AWS open server created by Amazon as it can speed the processing of substantial amount of flowing data. The implementation of the users' view may also be slightly prettified for better appealing to the young users, indeed, the undergraduate student mostly at their early 20s.

# Meeting Conclusion
Overall, the project is a massive success. Although we have spent so much more time than our original plan, witnessing our own success at the end is a gift to reward the hard work we input. May The Fork B With You team is proud of our project and looking forward to presenting our masterpiece to the entire CSCC01 course.

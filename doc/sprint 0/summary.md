# Summary
## Objective
To create a virtual space for semi-academic usage which allows students enrolled in the same course during the same semester to easily connect with other students, TA and professors for socializing, academic inquires and resource sharing. 


## Key Personas
### John Appleseed
A 20 years old second year Computer Science student studying at University of Toronto Scarborough campus. He is introverted and finds it difficult to talk to complete strangers in his class. He also feels uncomfortable asking question publicly in class or going to office hours. However, he is extremely active online. So when he needs help, he cannot find anyone to talk to and does not seek help from the Professor or from Teaching Assistants. 
 
### Serena Ma
A teaching assistant that is a student at St.George campus but has a TA position at UTSC. Because of her schedule, she can only teach the tutorial but doesn’t have time to commute to UTSC for office hours. She tried very hard to squeeze time but it is almost impossible. There are only 2 TAs for the course and it is mandatory to dedicate a few hours per week to help students. Furthermore, the course he teaches has more than 200 students. Every day he receives email asking repetitive questions resulting him to answer the same question over 
and over again.
 
### Paco
A professor at UTSC Computer Science department. He teaches CSCC85 Embedded System this summer. He is a responsible professor who tries to dedicate as much time as possible to help students to be successful in his course.  However, he noticed the midterm average was very low. But during his Office Hours, only a few students seek for help. He checks the discussion board on Blackboard and notices it is inactive. He then notices, his colleague who uses Piazza for Q & A has a very active discussion. But Piazza is licensed under University and is not free to use. 


## Key Scenarios
### Overview
* Students can use this to make teams for specific courses
* Ask others for assistance in coursework or studying for examination
* Chat with the Professor online
* Collection of notes/solutions and important notices/reminders (like pinned posts in Piazza but could be in a better format)
* Students can form tight bonds with their classmates and make friends easily. This will help them organize teams for group projects in upper year courses and obtain helpful social and professional connections with each other.
### Details
John comes to university on the first day of school and has CSCA08. He doesn’t know anyone taking that course and people on the campus. It’s his first year, so he really wants to make new friends. He is not that experienced in programming and didn’t do programming in high school, so he would need help from peers, TAs and professor. 
 
Mary is a third year biology students and takes CSCB20 so far. She is not involved in Computer and Mathematics Department so she hasn’t made any friends who are also taking this course. She is eager to make a team with classmates for the imminent group project but she is too shy to ask her classmates in person. She needs a friendly but professional social media to request for joining a team or forming a team with a few classmates.



## Key Principles
1) *Finding rooms for specific course* - The design needs to make finding rooms easy for specific courses. As more users register and use the app, there will be more and more rooms. 
2) *Asking questions comfortably* - Every user should not feel uncomfortable or embarrassed for posting questions. 
3) *Finding users enrolled in same course* - The design ensure student is able to connect with other students enrolled in the same course easily. 
4) *Using app should be enjoyable* - User experience with the APP must not be dry and must be entertaining. 
5) *Being able to “friend” with each others* - Users are able to send friend request to each other and start a private chat.
6) *Discussing professional topics in portable app* - Users have easy access to a social media to talk about academic questions and acquire knowledge

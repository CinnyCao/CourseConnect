# Meeting Overview:


In this retrospective, our team, May The Forks B With You reflected the success and errors that occured in Sprint 1. All members are present in the meeting.

At the beginning, the team modifies the product backlog to match the up-to-date progress of the completion of CourseConnect web app. This is because User's Profile page, originally planned for Sprint 2, has already been started by the team members after all user's stories in Sprint 1 are implmented. The front end user's view and controller of chatrooms are also moved forward from Sprint 2 to Sprint 1 and finished in Sprint 1. The progress of database design and implementation of AWS server has also been recorded and tracked in Pivotal Tracker accordingly. 

As a result, the predicted velocity for Sprint 2 has been increased to 12 due to the fact the points finished in Sprint 1 were improved to 12 from 10. Some user's stories have their values and priorities changed based on the recent achievement of the team. They are re-ranked according to their new points and priority in order to better match the progress and interest of each team member. Higher level of efficiency and faster velocity are expected in the upcoming Sprints. In regards of the views, the User Profile Page will me merged with the Land-in Page and automatically appear after the users sign in. All team members support this change as this is more convenient at users' perspectives.

More complicated and structural database will be designed and coordinated with our controllers and viewers due to the need of accomodating large scale of data and information regarding the users and their text messages and question threads. The AWS server where the entire project is currently operated will be maintained and enriched for effectivity and advanced quality. Minor changes may be applied to it for unforeseeable difficulties the app may encounter in the future Sprints.

In the reflection, the strengths the team owns as a whole have been identified:
- Effective and smooth communications are conducted among the team members in Slack
- Active involvement in the tasks assigned in the group meeting.
- Up-to-date on Github, the version-control tool and review the pull requests immediately after they are created.
- Eusuring every team member is on the right track and receives the sufficient assistance.
- The distribution of user stories is reasonable for the first Sprint.


Our approach to sprint 1 was in general commendable as perceived by each of the teammate. The working style of the team is efficient opposite to leaving all the tasks to the last minute. We decided to keep up this productivity in the prospective Sprints so our project can be successfully completed on time. Expected improvements need to be made on the clarity of important group announcements regarding meetings and discussions. Every team member should be fully informed of the possible changes and recommendations on the designs and implementations. In essence, the consistency of each individual's progress should be guaranteed.

# Meeting Conclusion:
The Scrum Retrospective meeting for May The Forks B With You is successfully organized on the first Sprint. We summarized the strengths that has boosted our efficiency and will keep applying them on the next Sprints for the outstanding achievement of the project.

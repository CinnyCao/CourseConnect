##### June 18th 2017 | 15:20 AM - 17:50 AM

1. Our product owner was chosen to be Sameul Gao. First, the product owner has talked about the rough design of this sprint and its effect on the project overall. The features that have to be implemented in this sprint has been discussed in detail. As well, a few adjustments have been suggested and performed on the priority and points of the user stories in this sprint based on the advice of product owner. At the very beginning of the meeting, the work is distributed to the participants. This disussion is directed by the product owner.
2. CRC has been discussed during the meeting. Due to the fact that our product is a web application, the definition of each class is not as clear as Android app or any projects developed by Java and Python. In our project, each json file for controller will be treated as a class and identified as a table in the CRC model. 
3. The definition of done is also brought up in the meeting since during the implementation, some pre-defined standard of completion has been proved impossible or unncessary to finish. The modification of definition of done leads to the discussion on spliting some user stories. However, all participants decide to keep the existent user stories unchanged and intact. 
4. We talked about the details regarding implementation. The product owner recommends us the solution to hook up front-end(controller), back-end and database. The setup of web API and json codes have been gone over by the product owner. The embedded database on nodejs used to remain as a confusion for us but now becomes clarified. 
5. The UI design of project for the first demo has been decided. Only the functions realized in this sprint will be made visible for users to select.
6. The meeting is conducted with efficient and clear communications. No major difficulties are encountered in the meeting. The decisions made finally have been fully discussed among the participants. The availability and possible schedules for scrum meeting and future meetup has been briefed but exact conclusions have not been produced.
